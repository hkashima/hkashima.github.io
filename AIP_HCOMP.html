In spite of the recent significant advances of artificial intelligence technologies, it is still difficult for machines to solve open-world and knowledge-intensive problems. Human computation is a promising idea of combining human intelligence and machine intelligence to solve such “AI-hard” problems. Our team focuses on basic theoretical and algorithmic tools of human computation and methodologies of human-in-the-loop AI systems as well as applications of AI technologies to developing human skills.	
Our research topics include:
<ol>
<li> Foundations of human computation:</li> 
  One of the most major technical issues in human computation is quality assurance because human computation is mainly executed on crowdsourcing platforms with unspecified people having various levels of skills, knowledges, or diligence, and therefore the quality of results is unstable.
  We focus on statistical aggregation methods for various question types as well as mechanism design to motivate people to participate into human computation.
  For example, we focus on knowledge intensive questions that only a small number of experts can correctly answer, such as ones asking medical knowledge, where the majority of members fail. 
  <li> Human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence:</li>
  Most of the real-world problems are hard to address only with machine intelligence, and we develop general methods to involve humans into machine learning systems. 
For example, we develop human-in-the-loop machine learning frameworks in which humans adaptively design new features useful for prediction, feature values are extracted by humans, and deep neural networks learn from crowd-labeled data. 
We also study a more general problem solving framework based on crowdsourcing that consists of collecting solution ideas, and organizing and prioritizing them for supporting decision making.
<li> Learning analytics</li>
 Not only exploiting human intelligence to develop intelligent systems, we also focus on helping human more intelligent. 
We study learning analytics that exploits artificial intelligence technology to boost human education at scale. 
One of our specific target areas is data science education through data science competitions. 
<li> Advanced machine learning algorithms and applications</li>
