In spite of the recent significant advances of artificial intelligence technologies, it is still difficult for machines to solve open-world and knowledge-intensive problems. Human computation is a promising idea of combining human intelligence and machine intelligence to solve such “AI-hard” problems. Our team focuses on basic theoretical and algorithmic tools of human computation and methodologies of human-in-the-loop AI systems as well as applications of AI technologies to developing human skills.	
Our research topics include:
<ol>
<li> Foundations of human computation</li> 
<li> Human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence</li>
<li> Learning analytics</li>
<li> Advanced machine learning algorithms and applications</li>
</ol>
